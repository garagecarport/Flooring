<p>Cheap Carports, Carport Garage, Portable Carport, Diy Currently, pricing average between $2,500 and $11,000 for a completed carport. Carports are usually open structures, but if you choose, it is possible to purchase a carport that has attached storage on the side. On average, carports cost about half as much as garages. Because of how and where the carport was attached to the house, building a traditional gabled roof, like other parts of the home, would have created more drainage problems than it would solve. A carport (also known as a porte cochere) provides a covered space next to the home for one or more vehicles to park or drop off groceries or people without going to the hassle of entering a garage.</p>
